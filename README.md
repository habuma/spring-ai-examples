# Spring AI Examples

This repository is where I'll commit various examples of using Spring AI.

You can clone this project in its entirety and work with it like that. *Or*
better, use the [SpringCLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cli/reference/index.html)
to select individual projects and create them locally.

now available at Manning.com, Amazon, and anywhere you buy tech books. It covers all aspects of
