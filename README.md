# Spring AI Examples

This repository is where I'll commit various examples of using Spring AI.

You can clone this project in its entirety and work with it like that. *Or*
better, use the [SpringCLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cli/reference/index.html)
to select individual projects and create them locally.

If you like this repository of example, then you're going to love [Spring AI in
Action](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-ai-in-action?a_aid=habuma&a_bid=f205d999&chan=habuma),
now available in Manning's Early Access Program (MEAP). It covers all aspects of
working with Spring AI with a fun example that runs throughout most of the book.
